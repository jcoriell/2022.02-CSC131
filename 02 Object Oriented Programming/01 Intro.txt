Object Oriented Programming
 - Objects are used to used to model real world items.

 - State and Behavior 
    - State - the collection of attributes that make up an Object
        Ex: A vehicle might have an attribute that describes:
            - the number of tires/wheels
            - number of doors
            - color
            - number of seats
            - make
            - model

        Ex: A person might have attributes:
            - vertical jump
            - the number of toes they have
            - height
            - favorite type of bread

        Ex: A pokemon
            - type
            - egg group
            - move set
            - attack stat
            - nickname

    - Behavior - the collection of actions an object can do
        Ex: Vehicle
            - combust()
            - fill_tank()
            - move_forward()
            - move_backwards()
            - move_upwards()
            - toast_bread() <- for vehicles with toasters
            - turn_on_radio()
        
        Ex: People
            - spend_money()
            - consume()
            - type()
            - die()
            
        Ex: Pokemon
            - faint()
            - attack()
            - miss_attack()
            - critical_hit()
            - level_up()
            - eat()
            - set_hp()

- Classes and Instances
    - A class represents a blueprint or template for an object (or instance).
    - Instantiation is the process of creating an instance of a class.
    - One individual instance is an object.
